A Nautilus developer has stored confidential data on the jump host within Stratos DC. To ensure security and compliance, this data must be transferred to one of the app servers. Given developers lack direct access to these servers, the system admin team has been enlisted for assistance.

Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 placing it in the directory /home/web.

Secure File Transfer Task
1️⃣ Task Understanding
🔹 What is the task?

A confidential file stored on the Jump Server must be securely copied to Application Server 1 (stapp01) and placed in:

/home/web


File to copy:

/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg

🔹 Why is this required in a real-world enterprise?

In enterprise environments:

Developers do NOT have direct access to production servers

Sensitive data must not remain on jump/bastion hosts

Jump servers are temporary access points, not storage locations

Compliance (ISO, SOC2, PCI-DSS) requires least privilege & secure data handling

👉 System Administrators act as controlled intermediaries to move data safely.

🔹 Which servers does this apply to?
Server	Role	Why
Jump Server	Secure access gateway	Source of the confidential file
App Server 1 (stapp01)	Application Tier	Authorized destination
NAS / DB / LB	❌ Not involved	No role in this task
2️⃣ Prerequisites & Assumptions
🔹 Required Access

SSH access to Jump Server

SSH access to App Server 1

Ability to write to /home/web
(either ownership or sudo access)

🔹 Required Files & Services

File exists:

/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg


SSH service running on both servers

Network connectivity between jump host and app server

🔹 Important Checks Before Starting
ls -l /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg


✔ Confirms file exists
✔ Confirms permissions
✔ Confirms file size (sanity check)

3️⃣ Exact Commands (Step-by-Step)

✅ Production-safe approach: scp
(encrypted, audited, standard enterprise tool)

🔹 Step 1: Login to Jump Server
ssh nautilus@jump-server


Explanation:

Establishes a secure SSH session

All transfers must originate from the jump host

Why this is best:

Jump server enforces audit logging

Direct access to app servers is restricted

🔹 Step 2: Copy File to App Server 1
scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg web@stapp01:/home/web/

Line-by-Line Explanation
Part	Meaning
scp	Secure Copy Protocol
/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg	Source file
web@stapp01	Destination user & server
/home/web/	Target directory

Why this command is best:

Encrypted in transit (SSH)

No temporary files created

Widely approved in enterprise environments

Simple, auditable, reliable

🔹 (Optional) If Permission Is Denied

Login to App Server and fix ownership:

ssh web@stapp01
sudo chown web:web /home/web

4️⃣ Verification & Validation
🔹 Verify on App Server 1
ssh web@stapp01
ls -l /home/web/nautilus.txt.gpg

✅ Expected Output Example
-rw-r--r-- 1 web web 2048 Jan 19  nautilus.txt.gpg

🔹 Verify File Integrity (Optional but Professional)

On jump server:

sha256sum /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg


On app server:

sha256sum /home/web/nautilus.txt.gpg


✔ Hashes must match

5️⃣ Errors & Troubleshooting
❌ Error: No such file or directory

Cause: File path incorrect
Fix:

ls -l /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg

❌ Error: Permission denied

Cause: No write access to /home/web
Fix:

sudo chown web:web /home/web

❌ Error: Connection timed out

Cause: SSH blocked / network issue
Fix:

ping stapp01
ss -tlnp | grep ssh

6️⃣ Security & Best Practices
🔐 Security Implications

.gpg file remains encrypted

Transfer happens over SSH

No exposure to unauthorized users

✅ Why This Approach Is Recommended

Least privilege

No data duplication

No SCP alternatives with weaker security

Fully auditable

🔄 Alternatives (Enterprise Scenarios)
Method	When Used
rsync -avz	Large files / resumable
SFTP	Automated pipelines
Ansible	Bulk or repeatable operations
7️⃣ Final Task Summary

What was done: Securely transferred encrypted file

From: Jump Server

To: App Server 1 (stapp01)

Destination: /home/web

Result: File successfully copied and verified

✅ Status: Successful

In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.

Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.

Task Understanding

Task:
Grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 2 (stapp02) so that all users can run it.

Why it's required in enterprise environments:

Scripts like xfusioncorp.sh are often used for automated tasks, such as backups, monitoring, or maintenance.

If the script lacks execution permissions, automation fails, which can disrupt business-critical processes (e.g., nightly backups).

Ensuring all users can execute the script is useful if multiple team members or automated jobs (cron, Jenkins) need to run it.

Server(s) involved:

App Server 2 (stapp02) – because this is where the script exists and lacks executable permission.

Not touching other servers unless required, following the principle of minimal changes in production.

2️⃣ Prerequisites & Assumptions
Prerequisite	Details
User Access	sudo access or root account (normal users cannot change permissions in /tmp for all users)
Required Files	/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh must exist. Check with ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
Services	None required to change permissions
Checks before starting	Verify script exists and current permissions using ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Example check:

ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


Expected output (example):

-rw-r--r-- 1 natasha natasha 2048 Jan 19 08:00 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


Here, -rw-r--r-- means no execute permissions.

3️⃣ Exact Commands (Step-by-Step)

Step 1: Switch to root or use sudo

sudo -i


sudo -i → gives root shell to safely execute privileged commands.

Why best: avoids repeated sudo before each command, standard in enterprise tasks.

Step 2: Grant execute permissions to all users

chmod a+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


Breakdown:

chmod → change file mode/permissions

a+x → a = all users (owner, group, others), +x = add execute permission

/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh → path to the script

Why best: explicitly grants execute to everyone without changing other permissions (safer than chmod 777).

Step 3: Verify permissions

ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


Expected output:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 natasha natasha 2048 Jan 19 08:00 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


rwxr-xr-x → owner has read/write/execute, group and others have read/execute. ✅

4️⃣ Verification & Validation

Test execution as any user

su - natasha
/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


Script should run without “Permission denied” errors.

If successful, all users can execute it.

Optional validation

stat /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh


Confirms detailed permission info (Access: 0755)

5️⃣ Errors & Troubleshooting
Error	Cause	Fix
Permission denied	Forgot sudo	Use sudo chmod a+x /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
No such file or directory	Script not present	Confirm with ls /tmp or copy script to /tmp
Script fails to run	Missing shebang (#!/bin/bash)	Add first line: #!/bin/bash

Pro tip: Always check file ownership. If script owned by root, all users still need x to execute.

6️⃣ Security & Best Practices

Security implications:

Giving execute to all users (a+x) is safe if the script is trusted.

Avoid chmod 777 – allows write for everyone (dangerous).

Keep scripts in /usr/local/bin for global execution in production; /tmp is temporary.

Recommended approach:

chmod a+x is minimal, safe, and transparent.

Validate script content before allowing all users to run.

Alternative:

Only grant x to specific group instead of all users if stricter control needed.

7️⃣ Final Task Summary

Action: Granted execute permission for all users on xfusioncorp.sh

Server: App Server 2 (stapp02)

Result: Script is now executable by everyone

Status: ✅ Successful

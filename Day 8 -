Within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus storage server hosts a directory named /data, serving as a repository for various developers non-confidential data. Developer mariyam has requested a copy of their data stored in /data/mariyam. The System Admin team has provided the following steps to fulfill this request:

a. Create a compressed archive named mariyam.tar.gz of the /data/mariyam directory.

b. Transfer the archive to the /home directory on the Storage Server.

What is the task?

You are required to:

Create a compressed archive (mariyam.tar.gz) of the directory

/data/mariyam


Move (store) that archive in:

/home


This is performed on the Storage Server inside the Stratos Datacenter.

In simple terms:
👉 Package Mariyam’s data safely into a single compressed file and place it in a user-accessible location.

Why is this required in a real enterprise environment?

In enterprise systems, this type of task is very common for:

Developer data handover

Backup before access revocation

Migration to another server

Audit or compliance requests

User exit / role change

Instead of giving raw directory access, admins archive data to:

Preserve structure

Reduce size

Prevent accidental modification

Enable secure transfers

Which server(s) does this apply to and why?
✅ Storage Server (Nautilus Storage Server)

Why?

The /data directory physically resides on the storage server

NAS / centralized storage is designed for shared developer data

This task must be executed where the data lives, not on app or DB servers

❌ Not on:

App servers (stapp01/02/03)

Load balancer

DB server

2️⃣ Prerequisites & Assumptions
Required User Access

sudo or root access is required

/data is typically owned by root or restricted groups

Archiving requires read access to all files

✔ Recommended:

sudo -i

Required Files / Services

Directory must exist:

/data/mariyam


tar utility must be installed
(Default on all enterprise Linux distributions)

Important Checks Before Starting
1. Confirm directory exists
ls -ld /data/mariyam

2. Ensure sufficient disk space in /home
df -h /home

3. Confirm no active write operations (best practice)

Avoid archiving while files are being modified

Prevents partial or inconsistent backups

3️⃣ Exact Commands (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Switch to root (recommended)
sudo -i

Explanation

Ensures full read access

Prevents permission-related failures

Why this is best

Enterprise systems avoid repeated sudo calls

Reduces command interruption risk

Step 2: Create the compressed archive
tar -czvf mariyam.tar.gz /data/mariyam

Line-by-line explanation

tar → Tape Archive utility (standard in Linux)

-c → Create a new archive

-z → Compress using gzip

-v → Verbose (shows progress, useful for admins)

-f mariyam.tar.gz → Output file name

/data/mariyam → Source directory

Why this command is the best choice

Industry standard

Preserves:

Permissions

Ownership

Directory structure

Compatible across Linux systems

Step 3: Move the archive to /home
mv mariyam.tar.gz /home/

Explanation

Moves the archive to a user-accessible, non-system directory

Why /home?

Safer than /root

Common location for:

Downloads

Transfers

SFTP access

4️⃣ Verification & Validation
1. Verify archive exists
ls -lh /home/mariyam.tar.gz

Expected output (example)
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120M Jan 19  mariyam.tar.gz

2. Verify archive contents (without extracting)
tar -tzf /home/mariyam.tar.gz

Expected behavior

Lists all files inside /data/mariyam

No error messages

3. Confirm archive integrity
gzip -t /home/mariyam.tar.gz

Expected output

No output → archive is valid

5️⃣ Errors & Troubleshooting
❌ Error: tar: /data/mariyam: Cannot open: Permission denied
Cause

Insufficient permissions

Fix
sudo -i

❌ Error: No such file or directory
Cause

Path is incorrect

Fix
ls /data


Confirm correct directory name.

❌ Error: No space left on device
Cause

/home filesystem is full

Fix

Free space or use an alternate mount:

df -h

6️⃣ Security & Best Practices
Security Implications

Archives may contain sensitive internal data

Must be:

Owned by root

Not world-writable

Transferred securely if moved off-server

Why this approach is recommended

Non-destructive

Auditable

Reversible

Aligns with enterprise backup practices

Alternatives (When Needed)

rsync → for live sync

Encrypted archive:

tar -czf - /data/mariyam | gpg -c > mariyam.tar.gz.gpg

7️⃣ Final Task Summary

Task: Archive developer Mariyam’s data

Server: Nautilus Storage Server

Action: Created mariyam.tar.gz from /data/mariyam

Location: /home/mariyam.tar.gz

Status: ✅ Successful

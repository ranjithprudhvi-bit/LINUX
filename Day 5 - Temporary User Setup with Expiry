Task Description (Exact Requirement)

Create a user named james on App Server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter.
Set the account expiry date to 2026-12-07, ensuring the username is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

1️⃣ Task Understanding
🔹 What is the task?

The task involves creating a temporary Linux user account named james on stapp02, with a predefined account expiry date.

Once the expiry date is reached, the user account will automatically be disabled by the system.

🔹 Why is this required in a real-world enterprise environment?

In enterprise environments like xFusionCorp Industries:

Temporary developers, consultants, or auditors often require time-bound access

Manual account removal is error-prone and may be forgotten

Expiry-based accounts:

Enforce least privilege

Reduce security risks

Ensure compliance with audit and access policies

This approach supports IAM (Identity & Access Management) best practices.

🔹 Which server does this task apply to and why?

Server: App Server 2 (stapp02)

Reason:
The requirement explicitly states that access is needed only on App Server 2, likely because:

The developer is working on a specific application component

Limiting access prevents lateral movement across servers

2️⃣ Prerequisites & Assumptions
🔐 Required Access Level

Root or sudo access is required
(User creation and account expiry settings are privileged operations)

📂 Required Services / Files

Standard Linux user management utilities:

/usr/sbin/useradd

/etc/passwd

/etc/shadow

(No additional services are required)

✅ Pre-Checks Before Starting

Confirm you are on the correct server:

hostname


Expected:

stapp02


Ensure the user does not already exist:

id james


Expected:

id: james: no such user

3️⃣ Exact Commands (Step-by-Step)
🔹 Step 1: Switch to Root (if not already)
sudo -i


Explanation:

Opens a root shell

Required for user and account policy management

Why this is best:

Avoids permission issues

Ensures full auditability

🔹 Step 2: Create the User with Expiry Date
useradd -e 2026-12-07 james

🔍 Command Breakdown
Component	Meaning
useradd	Standard Linux command to create users
-e 2026-12-07	Sets account expiry date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
james	Username (lowercase as per policy)
✅ Why this is the best choice

Native Linux tool (enterprise standard)

Expiry enforced at OS level

No cron jobs or manual cleanup required

4️⃣ Verification & Validation
🔹 Verify User Creation
id james


Expected Output:

uid=1005(james) gid=1005(james) groups=1005(james)

🔹 Verify Account Expiry Date
chage -l james


Expected Output:

Account expires                                        : Dec 07, 2026
Password expires                                       : never
Password inactive                                      : never
Account inactive                                       : never

🔹 Confirm Entry in System Files
grep james /etc/passwd


Expected Output:

james:x:1005:1005::/home/james:/bin/bash


✔ Confirms the user is properly registered

5️⃣ Errors & Troubleshooting
❌ Error 1: User Already Exists
useradd: user 'james' already exists


✅ Fix:

userdel -r james


(Only after confirming it’s safe to remove)

❌ Error 2: Invalid Date Format
useradd: invalid date format


✅ Fix:

Ensure format is YYYY-MM-DD

useradd -e 2026-12-07 james

❌ Error 3: Permission Denied
useradd: Permission denied


✅ Fix:

sudo useradd -e 2026-12-07 james

6️⃣ Security & Best Practices
🔐 Security Implications

Prevents orphaned accounts

Reduces attack surface

Supports audit and compliance (ISO / SOC)

✅ Why this approach is recommended

OS-level enforcement

No dependency on manual processes

Fully auditable

🔄 Alternative (Not Recommended Here)
chage -E 2026-12-07 james


✔ Works only after user creation
❌ Two-step process (less clean)

7️⃣ Final Task Summary

✅ User created: james

🖥️ Server: App Server 2 (stapp02)

⏳ Expiry date: 2026-12-07

🔐 Access: Temporary, policy-compliant

📊 Status: ✅ Successful
